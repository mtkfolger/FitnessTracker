# FitnessTracker
This application will allow users to view, create and track daily workouts. Users can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, including the name of the workout, the type of workout, the weight, number of sets and reps during the workout, as well as the duration of the exercise. If the exercise is cardio related, users can also log the distance of the workout.
